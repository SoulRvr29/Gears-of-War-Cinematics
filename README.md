# Gears of War Cinematics

A page about the cinematics I made in the unreal editor for the first Gears of War. There are also gameplays of playable levels, unfinished levels and test levels. In the mini-games section, there are games that I coded in javascript. For now, the page is very simple, I will add more content over time.
